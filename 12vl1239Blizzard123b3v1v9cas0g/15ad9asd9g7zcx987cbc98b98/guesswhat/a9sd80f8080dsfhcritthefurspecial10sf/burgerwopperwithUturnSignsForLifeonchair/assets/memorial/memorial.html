        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>4/19/2024</p>
        <p>I got a sandwich for lunch. The lady asked me to get a fruit as well. I got a banana. I like bananas, but this one was green and completely underripe. So instead of eating it, I threw it at Andrew. He thought it would be like yesterday, where Kenji obliterated the banana and then we laughed about it and threw it away. Except that didn't happen. He tried to squish the banana, but instead of twisting it like Kenji did, he just squeezed it. Instead of doing what he thought it would do, the banana ripped and started oozing out disgusting underripe banana juice. We thought it was super funny, so I grabbed it and messed with it more. Andrew yelled "it's gonna blow!" so I let go. But the banana had become topheavy because the entire thing was sitting on the top of the deflated peel, so all of the nasty banana chunks fell onto the table. I don't even know who ended up throwing away the peel, but I was getting increasingly paranoid because I knew it was only a matter of time before the janitor lady came over. We had to clean the banana up fast, before she came over and yelled at us like she usually does. Some stupid kids started banging on the piano, and she started yelling and walked over in the direction of the piano. Which just so happened to be right behind our table. We scrambled to hide the banana chunks with our Chromebooks, and it worked. We were all relieved, and looked away to start chatting at each other. I still don't know who did it, but by the time I looked back, the gross banana chunks were covered in milk. Now it was really disgusting, and it would be even harder to clean. We argued about who had to clean it up and started chanting "FRY THE FISH!" but nobody wanted to clean it. I wonder why... Although Justin initially yelled "I'm not cleaning that S%&# up!" he ended up using tinfoil from somebody's hamburger and a plastic spoon to take away the chunks. Then he used tons of napkins to wipe up the milk, and I took it to the trash. Oops.</p>
